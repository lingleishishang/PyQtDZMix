PyQtDZMix is a Python-based software tool designed for zircon U-Pb dating and material source analysis. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies complex geochronological data analysis, making it accessible to geochemists, sedimentologists, and researchers without advanced programming skills. The software integrates advanced statistical methods, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Kuiper tests, and dynamic 2D/3D visualizations to facilitate accurate and reproducible provenance analysis.

User-Friendly GUI:
Designed with PyQt5, PyQtDZMix offers an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to interact with the software without the need for coding or complex configuration.

Data Validation:
Automatically validates U-Pb zircon datasets (CSV format) for completeness and correctness before analysis.

Statistical Analysis Tools:
Includes advanced statistical methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, Kuiper test, Q-Q plots, and cross-correlation to compare zircon age distributions and assess sample similarity.

Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs):
Utilizes KDEs and probability density functions (PDFs) for mixture-based provenance analysis, improving the accuracy of material source identification.

Dynamic Visualizations:
Generates interactive 2D and 3D visualizations to help researchers explore complex datasets. Visualizations include band plots (for two sources), ternary diagrams (for three sources), and quaternary diagrams (for four sources).

Sampling Flexibility:
Supports both random and non-random sampling, giving researchers the ability to focus on specific subsets of data or analyze the entire dataset.

Export Options:
Allows users to export visualizations and results in image formats and data in CSV format for further analysis.
